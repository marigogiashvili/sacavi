    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language <br> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the <br> meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies <br> such aas Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <br> render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <br> web page semantically included cues for its appearance. </p>

    <p><h2>What is CSS?</h2></p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheets language used for describing the presentation <br>of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML ). <br> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br> CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br> This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation <br> characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate. css file, <br> which reduces complexity and repetition in the structular content;and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load <br> speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
